Keep it simple and relevant: Avoid jargon and hyperbole. Focus on the message you want to send and use keywords your reader would use.
Speak to the benefits and create desire: People don’t want a thing — they want the outcome of that thing. Target that outcome with your 
copy and paint a picture that motivates your readers to engage.
Create contrast and bridge the gap: Your readers need to understand their current situation to clearly see how your counterarguments 
provide an obvious solution to the core pains, gains, and jobs they haven’t overcome yet.
